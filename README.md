latexnodes
==========

This project converts a basic notes format to latex. It features bulleted
lists (currently tab-indented) which transform to "itemize" blocks,
shortcuts for pygmentized inline sourcecode, italics/underline/boldface,
section/subsection/subsubsection headers, and arbitrary '[]'-delimited \being/\end blocks.

It also allows for the inlining of shell commands for file includes or
anything else. These shortcuts are chosen to (a) not interfere with
standard latex syntax and (b) be generally more ergonomic than standard
latex.
